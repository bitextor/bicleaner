Bicleaner (bicleaner-classify) is a tool in Python that aims at detecting noisy sentence pairs in a parallel corpus. It
indicates the likelihood of a pair of sentences being mutual translations (with a value near to 1) or not (with a value near to 0). Sentence pairs considered very noisy are scored with 0.

Although a training tool (bicleaner-train) is provided, you may want to use the available ready-to-use language packages. 
Please, visit https://github.com/bitextor/bitextor-data/releases to download the language packages.
Visit our [Wiki](https://github.com/bitextor/bicleaner/wiki/How-to-train-your-Bicleaner) for a detailed example on Bicleaner training.

## Installation & Requirements

Bicleaner works with Python 3.6 and can be instaled with `pip`:

```bash
python3.6 -m pip install bicleaner
```

Bicleaner requires the [KenLM](https://github.com/kpu/kenlm) Python bindings with support for 7-gram language models. You can easily install
them by running the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kpu/kenlm
cd kenlm
python3.6 -m pip install . --install-option="--max_order 7"
cd build
cmake .. -DKENLM_MAX_ORDER=7 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/your/prefix/path
make -j all install
```  
The remaining extra modules required by Bicleaner will be automatically downloaded and installed/upgraded (if required) with the first command.

After installation, four binary files (`bicleaner-train`,  `bicleaner-train-lite`, `bicleaner-classify` and `bicleaner-classify-lite`) will be located in your `python/installation/prefix/bin` directory. This is usually `$HOME/.local/bin` or `/usr/local/bin/`.

## Cleaning

`bicleaner-classify` aims at detecting noisy sentence pairs in a parallel corpus. It
indicates the likelihood of a pair of sentences being mutual translations (with a value near to 1) or not (with a value near to 0). Sentence pairs considered very noisy are scored with 0.

By default, the input file  (the parallel corpus to be classified) must contain at least four columns, being:

* col1: URL 1
* col2: URL 2
* col3: Source sentence
* col4: Target sentence

but the source and target sentences column index can be customized by using the `--scol`and `--tcol` flags.

Any extra columns will be ignored.

The generated output file will contain the same lines and columns that the original input file had, 
adding an extra column containing the Bicleaner classifier score.

This tool can be run with

```bash
bicleaner-classify [-h]
                   [-S SOURCE_TOKENISER_PATH]
                   [-T TARGET_TOKENISER_PATH] 
                   [--scol SCOL]
                   [--tcol TCOL] 
                   [--tmp_dir TMP_DIR]
                   [-b BLOCK_SIZE] 
                   [-p PROCESSES] 
                   [-d DISCARDED_TUS]
                   [--threshold THRESHOLD]
                   [--lm_threshold LM_THRESHOLD]

                   [--disable_lang_ident]                   
                   [-q] 
                   [--debug] 
                   [--logfile LOGFILE] 
                   [-v]
                   input 
                   [output] 
                   metadata

```

### Parameters

* positional arguments:
  * input: Tab-separated files to be classified  (line format: URL1 URL2 SOURCE_SENTENCE TARGET_SENTENCE [EXTRA_COLUMNS], tab-separated)
  * output: Output of the classification (default: standard output)
  * metadata: Training metadata (YAML file), generated by `bicleaner-train` or [downloaded](https://github.com/bitextor/bitextor-data/releases/tag/bicleaner-v1.0) as a part of a language pack. You just need to untar the language pack for the pair of languages of the file you want to clean. The tar file contains a YAML metadata file.  
* optional arguments:
  * -h, --help: show this help message and exit
* Optional:
  * -S SL_TOKENIZER_PATH: Source language tokenizer absolute path. If not given, Moses tokenizer is used.
  * -T TL_TOKENIZER_PATH: Target language tokenizer absolute path. If not given, Moses tokenizer is used.
  * --scol SCOL           Source sentence column (starting in 1) (default: 3)
  * --tcol TCOL           Target sentence column (starting in 1) (default: 4)
  * --tmp_dir TMP_DIR: Temporary directory where creating the temporary files of this program (default: default system temp dir, defined by the environment variable TMPDIR in Unix)
  * -b BLOCK_SIZE, --block_size BLOCK_SIZE Sentence pairs per block (default: 10000)
  * -p PROCESSES, --processes PROCESSES: Number of processes to use (default: all CPUs minus one)

  * --threshold THRESHOLD: Threshold for classifier. If accuracy histogram is present in metadata, the interval for max value will be given as a default instead the current default. (default: 0.5)
 * --lm_threshold LM_THRESHOLD: Threshold for language model fluency scoring. All sentence pairs whose LM fluency score falls below the threshold are removed (classifier score set to 0), unless the option --keep_lm_result is set. (default: 0.5)
  * --keep_lm_result: Add an additional column to the results with the language model fluency score and do not set the classifier score to 0 for any sentence pair. (default: False)
  * --score_only: Only output one column which is the bicleaner score (default: False)
  * --disable_hardrules: Disables the bicleaner_hardrules filtering (only bicleaner_classify is applied) (default: False)
  * --disable_lang_ident: Don't apply hardrules that use language detecting (default: False)

* Logging:
  * -q, --quiet: Silent logging mode (default: False)
  * --debug: Debug logging mode (default: False)

### Example

```bash
bicleaner-classify  \
        corpus.en-es.raw  \
        corpus.en-es.classifed  \
        training.en-es.yaml 
```

This will read the "corpus.en-es.raw" file, 
classify it with the classifier indicated in the "training.en-es.yaml" metadata file,
writing the result of the classification in the "corpus.en-es.classified" file.
Each line of the new file will contain the same content as the input file, adding a column with the score given by the Bicleaner classifier.

### Automatic test

We included a small test corpus and a script to check that your Bicleaner classifier is working as expected. 
In order to use it, just run:

```bash
python3.6 -m pytest -s tests/bicleaner_test.py
```

This will download the required language pack, classify the provided test corpus, and check the resulting classification scores. If everything went as expected, the output will be "1 passed in XX.XX seconds".  All downloaded data will be removed at the end of the testing session.

## Training classifiers

In case you need to train a new classifier (i.e. because it is not available in the language packs provided at [bitextor-data](https://github.com/bitextor/bitextor-data/releases), 

you can use `bicleaner-train` .
`bicleaner-train` is a Python3 tool that allows you to train a classifier which predicts 
whether a pair of sentences are mutual translations or not and discards too noisy sentence pairs.

### Requirements 

In order to train a new classifier, you must provide:
* A clean parallel corpus (100k pairs of sentences is the recommended size)
* SL-to-TL and TL-to-SL gzipped probabilistic bilingual dictionaries. You can check their format by downloading any of the available language packs
   * The SL-to-TL probabilistic bilingual dictionary must contain one entry per line. Each entry must contain the following 3 fields, split by space, in this order: TL word, SL word, probability.
   * The TL-to-SL probabilistic bilingual dictionary must contain one entry per line. Each entry must contain the following 3 fields, split by space, in this order: SL word, TL word, probability.
   * We recommend filtering out entries with a very low probability: removing those with a probability 10 times lower than the maximum translation probability for each word speeds up the process and does not decrease accuracy.
   * Prior to inferring the probabilistic dictionaries, sentences must be tokenizer with the Moses tokenizer (with the `-a` flag) and lowercased.
   * You can uses Moses and MGIZA++ to obtain probabilistic dictionaries from a parallel corpus.

Optionally, if you want the classifier to include an improved fluency filter based on language models, you must also provide:
* A monolingual corpus made ONLY of noisy sentences in the SL (100k sentences is the recommended size)
* A monolingual corpus made ONLY of noisy sentences in the TL (100k sentences is the recommended size)

Moreover, **`lmplz`, the command to train a KenLM language model must be in `PATH`**. See https://github.com/kpu/kenlm for instructions about its compilation and installation.

In principle, if you want to use Bicleaner to clean a partially noisy corpus, it could be difficult to find a corpus made solely of noisy sentences. Fortunately, there are two options available with Bicleaner: 

### Extracting noisy sentences from an existing corpus with heuristic rules

Given a parallel corpus, you use `bicleaner-hardrules` to extract some of its noisiest sentences using heuristic rules by running the following command:

```bash
  bicleaner-hardrules [-h]
                      [--annotated_output] 
                      -s SOURCE_LANG
                      -t TARGET_LANG 
                      [--tmp_dir TMP_DIR]
                      [-b BLOCK_SIZE]
                      [-p PROCESSES]
                      [--disable_lang_ident]
                      [--scol SCOL] 
                      [--tcol TCOL]
                      [INPUT_FILE]
                      [OUTPUT_FILE]

```
where `INPUT_FILE` contains a sentence-aligned parallel corpus, with a sentence pair per line. Sentences are split by tab. `OUTPUT_FILE` will contain all the input sentences, with an extra score column with `0` (if the sentence is noisy and should be discarded) or `1` (if the sentence is ok). When the `--annotated_output` flag is in use, `OUTPUT_FILE` will contain another extra column, specifying the heuristic rule applied to decide discarding each sentence (or `keep`, if the sentence is ok and should not be discarded). If the `--disable_lang_ident` flag is in use, rules that require language identification are not used. '--scol' and '--tcol' allow to indicate which columns contains source and target in the input file (default: `1`and `2`, respectively)

You can then obtain the monolingual noisy corpora by "cutting" the appropriate columns (after running `bicleaner-hardrules` with the `--annotated_output` flag). Asuming scol=1 and tcol=2, and no more columns in the input corpus (so the hardrules score is the 3rd column in the output):

```bash
cat OUTPUT_FILE | awk -F'\t' '{if ($3 == 0) print $1 }' > MONOLINGUAL_NOISY.SOURCE_LANG
cat OUTPUT_FILE | awk -F'\t' '{if ($3 == 0) print $2 }' > MONOLINGUAL_NOISY.TARGET_LANG
```

### Building synthetic noisy sentences

```bash
cat TRAINING_CORPUS | cut -f1 | python3.6 bicleaner/utils/shuffle.py - > MONOLINGUAL_NOISY.SOURCE_LANG
cat TRAINING_CORPUS | cut -f2 | python3.6 bicleaner/utils/shuffle.py - > MONOLINGUAL_NOISY.TARGET_LANG
```

### Parameters

It can be used as follows. Note that the parameters `--noisy_examples_file_sl`, `--noisy_examples_file_tl`, `--lm_file_sl`, `--lm_file_tl`, are mandatory if you want to enable improved fluency filter based on language models (recommended).

### Example

```bash
bicleaner-train \
          corpus.en-cs.train\
          --treat_oovs \
          --normalize_by_length \
          -s en \
          -t cs \
          -d dict-en-cs.gz \
          -D dict-cs-en.gz \
          -b  1000 \
          -c en-cs.classifier \
          -g 50000 \
          -w 50000 \
          -m training.en-cs.yaml \
          --classifier_type random_forest
```

This will train a Random Forest classifier for English-Czech using the corpus corpus.en-cs.train and the probabilistic dictionaries `dict-en-cs.gz` and `dict-cs-en.gz`. 
This training will use 50000 good and 50000 bad examples, and a block size of 1000 sentences.
The classifier data will be stored in `en-cs.classifier`, with the metadata in `training.en-cs.yaml`. The improved fluency language model filter will not be included.

The generated .yaml file provides the following information, that is useful to get a sense on how good or bad was the training  (and is also a needed input file for classifying):

## Lite versions

Although `bicleaner-train` and `bicleaner-classify` make use of parallelization  by distributing workload to the available cores, some users might prefer to implement their own parallelization strategies. For that reason, single-thread versions of Bicleaner scripts are provided: `bicleaner-train-lite` and `bicleaner-classify-lite`. The usage is exactly the same as for the full versions, but omitting the blocksize (-b) and processes (-p) parameter.
